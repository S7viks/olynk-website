## Design Decisions Explained

### **Why Pure White Background?**
- Removes visual noise
- Card becomes the only focal point
- Feels more premium and serious
- Common in enterprise software

### **Why Larger Card (900px)?**
- Matches modern SaaS products
- Allows comfortable line lengths
- Feels substantial, not cramped
- Room for generous padding

### **Why Left-Aligned Text?**
- More natural reading flow
- Professional/editorial aesthetic
- Easier to scan
- Feels less "marketing"

### **Why Checkboxes on Right?**
- Text-first reading order
- Industry standard (forms, surveys)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Less cluttered left edge

### **Why Integrated Progress?**
- Card feels complete/self-contained
- No floating elements
- Cleaner visual structure
- Progress + navigation together

---

## References Applied vs. Rejected

### ✅ **Applied from References**
- Canvas + focal card pattern (Creativwise)
- Strong section anatomy (diagram)
- One high-energy zone, rest calm (Base Club structure)
- Generous white space
- Clear visual hierarchy

### ❌ **Rejected from References**
- Neon colors (Base Club)
- Hand-drawn elements
- Overlapping stickers
- Loud gradients
- Playful illustrations
- Meme-like aesthetic

**Why:** Those work for consumer/crypto products, not enterprise operations tools

---

## Language + Visual Alignment

### **Language Rules:**
- Observational, not evaluative
- Minimal pronouns (you/we)
- Systems vocabulary
- No judgment, no scoring

### **Visual Support:**
- Clean, undecorated interface
- Professional typography
- No playful elements
- Serious color palette
- Calm transitions

**Result:** Language and visuals reinforce the same message: *"This is a serious operational tool"*

## Testing Instructions

### **1. Visual Check**
Visit http://localhost:5175/ and verify:
- [ ] Card feels substantial (not cramped)
- [ ] White space breathes naturally
- [ ] Hierarchy is immediately clear
- [ ] Nothing feels accidental or decorative

### **2. Interaction Check**
Complete the diagnostic and verify:
- [ ] Options are easy to click/tap (44px+ height)
- [ ] Hover states are subtle but clear
- [ ] Selected state is obvious
- [ ] Button disables appropriately
- [ ] Transitions feel smooth (not jarring)

### **3. Language Check**
