# Platform Page Flow — LOCKED

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-15  
**Status:** ✅ Section-by-Section Flow Approved

---

## THE JOB (1 SENTENCE)

> After scrolling the Platform page, the user should clearly understand **what OLynk is architecturally (four engines working together) and where it sits in their stack**, and feel compelled to **explore mechanics (How It Works) or see it live (Request Demo)**.

---

## USER CONTEXT (WHO LANDS HERE)

**Primary path:** Clicked "Platform" from Home page navigation

**User state:**
- Already saw demo (or static example)
- Understands "intelligence layer" concept
- Now wants architectural clarity

**User question:**
> "Okay, but what IS it exactly? How is it built? What are the pieces?"

---

## SCROLL FLOW (6 SECTIONS)

### SECTION 1: CATEGORY CLARITY

**Purpose:** Answer "What category is this?" in 10 seconds

**Content Structure:**
- **Headline:** "One Platform. Four Engines. Complete Intelligence."
- **Sub-headline:** "OLynk is the AI-native operations brain for modern businesses. Not just analytics—autonomous intelligence."
- **No CTA yet** (orientation first)

**What user learns:**
- This is a platform (not a tool)
- It has four distinct engines (architecture preview)
- It's autonomous (not reactive)

**What user does NOT learn:**
- Technical implementation details
- Pricing
- Feature lists

**Exit behavior:**
- Intrigued → Scrolls to learn about engines
- Skeptical → Bounces (fine, not ready)

---

### SECTION 2: THE FOUR ENGINES (VISUAL)

**Purpose:** Answer "What are the pieces?" — High-level component map

**Content Structure:**
- **Visual diagram:** Four connected boxes showing flow

```
[OLynk Fabric]    →    [OLynk Insight]
    ↓                        ↓
[OLynk Orbit]     ←    [OLynk Core]
```

**Each engine gets:**
- Icon (distinct visual)
- Name + Role statement (1 sentence)
- Key capability (1 bullet)

**Fabric:** "Unified data layer • Connects all operational tools"
**Insight:** "Predictive intelligence • 87.4% forecast accuracy"
**Core:** "Autonomous workflows • Executes actions 24/7"
**Orbit:** "Conversational AI • Ask questions, get answers"

**What user understands:**
- Four distinct layers
- Each has a job
- They work together (not siloed)

**What we do NOT do:**
- Deep technical specs
- API documentation
- Implementation details

**Why this works:**
- Visual > text for architecture
- Shows interconnection (not just list)
- Each role is clear and distinct

**Exit behavior:**
- "Tell me more about each" → Scrolls
- "How do they fit together?" → Scrolls
- "Skip to mechanics" → Clicks "How It Works"

---

### SECTION 3: FABRIC (UNIFICATION LAYER)

**Purpose:** Explain first engine in detail

**Content Structure:**
- **Engine name:** OLynk Fabric
- **Role:** Unified data layer
- **Problem it solves:** "Your data is scattered across 10+ tools. No single system has the full picture."

**What Fabric does:**
- Connects e-commerce, payments, logistics, CRM, ERP in real-time
- Creates single source of truth
- Syncs bidirectionally (not just extracts)
- No manual exports, no CSV hell

**Technical note (calm, brief):**
"OAuth authentication. API-native. Real-time webhooks. No code required."

**Visual aid:** Simple diagram showing tools flowing into Fabric

**What user understands:**
- Fabric is connectivity, not storage
- It doesn't replace tools
- Real-time, not batch

**Exit behavior:**
- "What happens to the data?" → Scrolls to Insight
- "How does it connect?" → Mentally satisfied, continues

---

### SECTION 4: INSIGHT (INTELLIGENCE LAYER)

**Purpose:** Explain the prediction engine

**Content Structure:**
- **Engine name:** OLynk Insight
- **Role:** Predictive intelligence engine
- **Problem it solves:** "You react to problems after they happen. No time to predict."

**What Insight does:**
- Analyzes operational patterns 24/7
- Predicts stockouts, RTO risk, cash crunches 7-30 days ahead
- Trained on operational data (not generic business metrics)
- 87.4% average forecast accuracy across 2.4M+ predictions

**Why it's different:**
"Most analytics tools show you what happened. OLynk Insight predicts what WILL happen—with causal reasoning, not just correlation."

**Visual aid:** Timeline showing prediction ahead of problem

**What user understands:**
- This is prediction, not reporting
- It's trained on operations (specific)
- Accuracy is proven (87.4%)

**Exit behavior:**
- "How does it use predictions?" → Scrolls to Core
- "I want to see this" → Clicks "Request Demo"

---

### SECTION 5: CORE (EXECUTION LAYER)

**Purpose:** Explain the automation engine

**Content Structure:**
- **Engine name:** OLynk Core
- **Role:** Autonomous workflow engine
- **Problem it solves:** "Your team spends 15+ hours weekly on manual tasks that could be automated."

**What Core does:**
- Runs intelligent workflows 24/7 based on Insight predictions
- Auto-creates POs, pauses campaigns, escalates delays, updates CRM
- Evaluates options before acting (not blind automation)
- Fully auditable (every action has reasoning)

**Why it's different:**
"Core doesn't just execute rules. It chooses the best action by simulating outcomes—then acts autonomously."

**Visual aid:** Decision tree showing "Predict → Simulate → Execute"

**What user understands:**
- This is autonomous, not reactive
- It thinks before acting (simulation)
- Every action is explained

**Exit behavior:**
- "How do I control this?" → Scrolls to Orbit
- "I need to see this working" → Clicks "Request Demo"

---

### SECTION 6: ORBIT (INTERFACE LAYER)

**Purpose:** Explain the conversational AI

**Content Structure:**
- **Engine name:** OLynk Orbit
- **Role:** Conversational intelligence interface
- **Problem it solves:** "You have questions. No one has time to analyze data."

**What Orbit does:**
- Natural language Q&A with your operational data
- Instant answers with visualizations
- Examples:
  - "Why did revenue drop yesterday?"
  - "Which SKUs need reordering?"
  - "Show cash flow forecast"
  - "What if prices up 10%?"

**Why it's different:**
"Orbit doesn't just search databases. It reasons across systems using Fabric + Insight to give context-aware answers."

**Visual aid:** Chat interface with sample questions/answers

**What user understands:**
- This is conversational, not dashboards
- It uses all other engines (connected)
- It's for everyone (not just analysts)

**Exit behavior:**
- "How does all this fit together?" → Scrolls to next section
- "I want to try this" → Clicks "Request Demo"

---

### SECTION 7: HOW IT ALL FITS

**Purpose:** Answer "Where does this sit in my stack?" — Reinforce positioning

**Content Structure:**
- **Headline:** "OLynk Sits Above Your Tools"
- **Visual diagram:**

```
YOUR EXISTING TOOLS
(Shopify, Razorpay, Shiprocket, Salesforce, Tally...)
              ↓
         [OLynk Platform]
    (Fabric → Insight → Core → Orbit)
              ↓
         YOUR TEAM
    (Intelligent insights + automation)
```

**Key statements:**
- "OLynk doesn't replace anything"
- "No rip-and-replace"
- "Works with your existing stack"
- "Intelligence layer, not another tool"

**What user understands:**
- Positioning is clear (above tools)
- No migration pain
- Complements existing investments

**Exit behavior:**
- "I get it now" → Ready for next step
- "Show me how this works" → Clicks "How It Works"
- "Let's talk" → Clicks "Request Demo"

---

### SECTION 8: NEXT STEPS (CONVERSION)

**Purpose:** Answer "What should I do next?" — Guided action

**Content Structure:**
- **Headline:** "Ready to See It in Action?"

**3 CTA cards (equal visual weight):**

**Card 1: See How It Works**
- "From chaos to intelligence in 3 steps"
- Links to → /how-it-works

**Card 2: Check If It Fits**
- "See use cases for your industry"
- Links to → /solutions

**Card 3: Request a Demo** (elevated)
- "See OLynk live with your data"
- Links to → /request-demo

**Why three CTAs:**
- Respects evaluation speed
- Curious → How It Works
- Qualifying → Solutions
- Ready → Demo

**Exit behavior:**
- Methodical evaluators → How It Works
- Self-qualifiers → Solutions
- Hot leads → Request Demo
