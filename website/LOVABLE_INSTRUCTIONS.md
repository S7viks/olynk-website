## After Generation

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Test thoroughly:** Check all sections, CTAs, and interactions
2. **Mobile testing:** Verify responsive design on different devices
3. **Content review:** Ensure all copy is correct
4. **Visual refinement:** Make any design tweaks

### Customization
Use Lovable's chat interface to make changes:
- "Make the hero section background darker"
- "Change the primary button color to #1E3A8A"
- "Add more spacing between sections"
- "Make the testimonial cards bigger"

### Export & Deploy
1. **Export code:** Download the complete codebase
2. **Local development:** Run locally with `npm install && npm run dev`
3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Push to GitHub
   - Connect to Vercel
   - Deploy (takes ~2 minutes)

---

## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ Do
- Copy the **entire prompt** without modifications
- Wait for complete generation before making changes
- Test on multiple devices after generation
- Use the chat interface for refinements

### ❌ Don't
- Edit the prompt unless you know what you're changing
- Interrupt the generation process
- Make major structural changes without re-generating
- Expect perfection on first try (iteration is normal)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Generation failed"
**Solution:** Try again. Sometimes Lovable has temporary issues. If it persists, break the prompt into smaller chunks and ask Lovable to "continue building" each section.

### Issue: "Some sections are missing"
**Solution:** Chat with Lovable: "You missed Section X. Please implement it as specified in the original prompt."

### Issue: "Colors don't match"
**Solution:** Chat with Lovable: "Update all colors to match the design system: Primary Blue #2B5288, Dark Navy #223148, etc."

### Issue: "Mobile version looks broken"
**Solution:** Chat with Lovable: "Fix mobile responsiveness. Stack all grid sections vertically on mobile, reduce font sizes, and ensure touch targets are 44x44px minimum."

## Alternative: Manual Development

If Lovable doesn't meet your needs, use **`BUILD_PROMPT.md`** instead and build manually with Next.js.

**When to use manual development:**
- Need custom backend integrations
- Require specific CMS (Contentful, Sanity)
- Want more control over architecture
- Building for production with high traffic
