# Home Page Scroll Flow — LOCKED

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-15  
**Status:** ✅ Section-by-Section Flow Approved for Implementation

---

## THE JOB (1 SENTENCE)

> After scrolling the Home page, the user should clearly understand **what OLynk is (AI brain for operations) and why it exists (businesses drowning in manual chaos)**, and feel compelled to **explore Platform/How It Works or request a demo**.

---

## SCROLL FLOW (7 SECTIONS)

### SECTION 1: ORIENTATION

**Purpose:** Answer "What is this?" in 10 seconds

**Content Structure:**
- Category definition: "The AI Brain for Business Operations"
- Value prop: "Predict problems. Automate decisions. Run your business on autopilot."
- Social proof: "150+ businesses • ₹450 Cr managed • 2.4M+ predictions"
- CTAs: "Request Demo" + "See How It Works"

**User learns:**
- Category (AI for operations)
- Benefit (autonomous operations)
- Credibility (real usage)

**User does NOT learn:**
- Technical details
- Components
- Features

**Exit behavior:**
- Hot leads → CTA
- Evaluators → Scroll

---

### SECTION 2: PROBLEM REALITY

**Purpose:** Answer "Why does this matter?" — Universal pain

**Content Structure:**
- Headline: "Your Best People Are Drowning in Operational Chaos"
- 4 quantified pain cards:
  1. Time waste: "10-15 hrs/week lost per user"
  2. Speed: "4-24 hour response times kill deals"
  3. Revenue risk: "40-70% from stockouts"
  4. Money leak: "₹2-8L monthly preventable losses"

**User feels:**
- Recognition ("This is my reality")
- Universality ("Not just me")
- Urgency ("Costing real money")

**Do NOT:**
- Mention OLynk yet
- Show solutions
- Be prescriptive

**Exit behavior:**
- Nods → Keeps scrolling
- Recognizes pain → Pays attention

---

### SECTION 3: THE SHIFT

**Purpose:** Answer "What's changing?" — Prime mental model

**Content Structure:**
- Headline: "The Old Way vs The New Way"
- Two-column contrast:

**OLD WAY:**
- Scattered data
- Manual Excel work
- Gut-feel decisions
- React to problems
- Human-operated

**NEW WAY:**
- Intelligence layer
- AI analyzes 24/7
- Predictions prevent problems
- Autonomous workflows
- Intelligence-operated

**User understands:**
- Category shift in progress
- Intelligence > tools
- Human + AI model

**Do NOT:**
- Name OLynk yet
- Show product
- Get technical

**Why this works:**
- Makes OLynk inevitable
- Removes "do I need this?" question
- Sets up Section 4

**Exit behavior:**
- Accepts shift → Ready for OLynk
- Resists → Churns (not ready)

---

### SECTION 4: WHAT OLYNK IS

**Purpose:** Answer "So what is OLynk, really?" — Mental model

**Content Structure:**
- Headline: "OLynk Is That Intelligence Layer"
- Simple explanation:
  "Sits between your tools and team. Analyzes data, predicts problems, automates workflows, answers questions—24/7, autonomously."

- 3 capability cards:
  1. **Predicts:** Stockouts, RTO, cash issues 7-30 days ahead
  2. **Automates:** POs, campaigns, CRM updates without humans
  3. **Answers:** Natural language Q&A with data

**User understands:**
- OLynk = intelligence layer (confirms Section 3)
- Doesn't replace tools, makes them intelligent
- Three core capabilities

**Do NOT:**
- Show architecture (Fabric/Insight/Core/Orbit)
- List features
- Technical specs

**Why this works:**
- Reinforces mental model
- Just enough detail
- Sets up Platform page

**Exit behavior:**
- "I get it" → Scrolls
- "Tell me more" → Clicks Platform/How It Works

---

### SECTION 5: HOW IT FITS

**Purpose:** Answer "Where in my stack?" — Remove fear

**Content Structure:**
- Headline: "OLynk Works With Your Existing Tools"
- Visual flow:
```
Your Tools → [OLynk Layer] → Your Team
```

- Reassurance:
  "Doesn't replace anything. Connects your tools, learns from your data, makes your stack intelligent."

**User understands:**
- No rip-and-replace
- No migration pain
- Integration, not replacement

**Do NOT:**
- List all integrations
- Technical architecture
- API details

**Why this works:**
- Removes #1 objection
- Visual instant clarity
- Reduces risk perception

**Exit behavior:**
- Fear reduced → Scrolls
- Wants specifics → Platform page

---

### SECTION 6: WHO IT'S FOR

**Purpose:** Answer "Is this for me?" — Recognition

**Content Structure:**
- Headline: "Built for Businesses Like Yours"
- 3 recognition cards:

**You're Facing This:**
- Multi-channel inventory
- Excel chaos
- Stockout revenue loss
- Cash flow surprises

**You're In These Industries:**
- E-commerce & D2C
- Retail
- Manufacturing
- B2B Services

**You're One of These Roles:**
- Founder / CEO
- COO / Operations
- CFO / Finance
- Supply Chain Lead

**User does:**
- Self-identifies
- Feels recognized

**Do NOT:**
- Case studies
- Testimonials
- Revenue requirements

**Why this works:**
- Fast self-qualification
- No pressure
- Outcome-focused

**Exit behavior:**
- "That's me" → Scrolls to CTA
- "Not sure" → Solutions page

---

### SECTION 7: WHAT TO DO NEXT

**Purpose:** Answer "What's my next step?" — Choice

**Content Structure:**
- Headline: "Choose Your Path"
- 3 equal CTA cards:

1. **Understand the Platform** → /platform
2. **See How It Works** → /how-it-works
3. **Request a Demo** (elevated) → /request-demo

**Why three CTAs:**
- Respects evaluation speeds
- Hot leads convert (Demo)
- Evaluators explore (Platform/How It Works)
- No dead ends

**Exit behavior:**
- Hot → Demo
- Curious → Platform/How It Works
- Skeptical → Bounces (fine)
