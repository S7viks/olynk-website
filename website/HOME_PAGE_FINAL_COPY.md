## SECTION 1: DEMO CONTAINER

### Static Intelligence Example (Fallback)

**Card Headline:**
```
Here's How OLynk Thinks
```

**Scenario Section:**
```
SCENARIO

Demand spike detected → 3 days from potential stockout
```

**Reasoning Section:**
```
OLYNK'S REASONING

• Current inventory: 340 units
• Velocity increased 23% vs forecast
• Supplier lead time: 6 days  
• Reorder window: 48 hours remaining
```

**Action Section:**
```
ACTION TAKEN

Created PO with Supplier B + reallocated 200 units from Warehouse 2

Problem prevented before anyone noticed
```

**CTA Copy:**

- Secondary: "Request Live Demo"

**Helper Text Below:**
```
The interactive demo is being built. This is what it will show.
```

---

## SECTION 2: ORIENTATION

**Headline:**
```
That Was Intelligence, Not Automation
```

**Body:**
```
What you just saw wasn't a dashboard showing past data. It wasn't automation rules reacting to problems.

It was OLynk reasoning across your systems—understanding cause and effect, simulating outcomes, and acting before problems become visible to customers.

This is how operational intelligence works.
```

**No CTA** (orientation, not conversion)

---

## SECTION 3: PROBLEM CONTEXT

**Section Headline:**
```
Why This Even Matters
```

**Section Sub-headline:**
```
Most businesses operate reactively—discovering problems after customers do.
```

**Problem Card 1: Fragmented Systems**
```
Fragmented Systems

Data scattered across 10+ tools. No single system understands how e-commerce, inventory, logistics, and finance connect.

You're flying blind.
```

**Problem Card 2: Reactive Operations**
```
Reactive Operations

Problems discovered too late—stockouts during campaigns, cash crunches mid-month, RTO spikes you didn't see coming.

Always firefighting. Never planning.
```

**Problem Card 3: Manual Decision-Making**
```
Manual Decision-Making

15+ hours weekly lost to Excel reconciliation. Gut-feel decisions. No time to analyze patterns—just reacting to what's urgent.

Not what's important.
```

**Problem Card 4: Hidden Causality**
```
Hidden Causality

You see symptoms (revenue down, delays up) but miss root causes. No way to understand how demand, inventory, logistics, and cash flow actually interact.

Treating effects, not causes.
```

---

## SECTION 4: WHAT OLYNK IS

**Section Headline:**
```
What Is OLynk, Exactly?
```

**Explanation Box:**
```
OLynk is an operational intelligence platform—it sits above your existing tools (e-commerce, ERP, CRM, logistics) and builds a live operational model of your business.

It doesn't just show you what happened.

It understands causality, predicts what will happen, simulates outcomes, and acts autonomously—24/7, without human intervention.
```

**Capability Card 1: Predicts**
```
Predicts

Stockouts, RTO risk, cash crunches 7-30 days ahead

With causal reasoning, not just pattern matching
```

**Capability Card 2: Simulates**
```
Simulates

Evaluates multiple possible actions, chooses best outcome

Before executing anything
```

**Capability Card 3: Acts**
```
Acts

Creates POs, pauses campaigns, updates CRM—autonomously

With full reasoning for every decision
```

---

## SECTION 5: HOW IT FITS

```
OLynk Works With Your Existing Tools
```

**Visual Flow Labels:**
```

OLYNK INTELLIGENCE LAYER
