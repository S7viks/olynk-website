**Sample Questions:**

- "What's my RTO pattern by region?"

**Sample Response (for "Why did revenue drop?"):**
```
Revenue dropped 18% yesterday (₹42K vs ₹51K).

Primary causes:
1. Campaign pause: Meta Ads "Festival Sale" paused at 2 PM (-₹6K impact)
2. Stockout: Top SKU "ABC123" out of stock since morning (-₹3K impact)

Recommended actions:
• Restart Meta campaign with adjusted budget
• Create PO for SKU ABC123 (500 units, 3-day delivery)
