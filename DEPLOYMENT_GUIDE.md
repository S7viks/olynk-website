# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Quick Fix for Deployment Failures

### 1. **Simplified Configuration**
I've simplified the Vercel configuration to remove potential conflicts:
- Removed complex headers that might cause issues
- Simplified routing rules
- Removed the `_redirects` file that was causing conflicts

### 2. **Deployment Steps**

1. **Commit and push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Force redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Find your project
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
   - Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

### 3. **If Deployment Still Fails**

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs:**
   - Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
   - Click on the failed deployment
   - Check the build logs for specific errors

2. **Common Issues and Solutions:**

   **Issue: Build timeout**
   - Solution: The simplified config should fix this

   **Issue: Missing dependencies**
   - Solution: All dependencies are now properly listed

   **Issue: TypeScript errors**
   - Solution: TypeScript compilation passes locally

   **Issue: Vite build errors**
   - Solution: Simplified Vite config should resolve this

### 4. **Manual Deployment**

If automatic deployment fails, try:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not installed
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy manually
vercel --prod
```

### 5. **Environment Variables**

Make sure these are set in your Vercel dashboard:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

### 6. **Expected Result**

After successful deployment:
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Site loads properly
- ✅ No MIME type errors
- ✅ All routes work correctly

### 7. **Troubleshooting**

If you still see deployment failures:

1. **Check the specific error message** in Vercel build logs
2. **Try deploying to a preview** first: `vercel` (without --prod)
3. **Clear Vercel cache**: `vercel --clear-cache`
4. **Check for any console errors** in the browser

### 8. **Contact Support**

If issues persist:
1. Share the specific error message from Vercel build logs
2. Check if the issue is with the build or runtime
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
