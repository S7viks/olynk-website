- Fallback: Static intelligence example works

**Risk 2: Copy Too Technical**
- Mitigation: Stakeholder review + user testing
- Fallback: Simplify on iteration

- Fallback: Progressive disclosure implemented

---

### **Medium Risks**

**Risk 4: Platform Page Too Long**

**Risk 5: Visual Design Too Minimal**
- Mitigation: User feedback on "trust" perception
- Fallback: Add subtle illustrations
