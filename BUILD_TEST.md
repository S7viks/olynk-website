# Build Test Guide

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **Terser Dependency Issue**
- **Problem**: `terser not found` error during build
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `terser` as dev dependency
  - Changed minifier to `esbuild` (faster and included by default)

### 2. **CSS Warning**
- **Problem**: CSS syntax error with escaped class names
- **Solution**: Updated Tailwind config to handle escaping properly

## Test the Build Locally

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Test the build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Expected output:**
   ```
   vite v6.3.5 building for production...
   ✓ 1976 modules transformed.
   ✓ built in 5.56s
   ```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the fixes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix build issues: add terser dependency and fix CSS warnings"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - The deployment should now succeed
   - No more terser errors
   - No more CSS warnings

## What Was Fixed

- ✅ **Terser dependency** - Added to package.json
- ✅ **Minifier configuration** - Using esbuild instead of terser
- ✅ **CSS escaping** - Updated Tailwind config
- ✅ **Build process** - Should now complete successfully

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Check that the site loads properly
2. Verify all routes work correctly
3. Test the waitlist funnel functionality
4. Ensure authentication works as expected
