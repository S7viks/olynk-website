# Language Fixes Applied - Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **1. Diagnostic Questions**
- Removed all "We" and "Our" pronouns
- Changed to passive voice: "Issues are discovered..." instead of "We discover..."
- Made questions more observational, less personal
- Simplified language: "When demand changes" vs. "When demand changes unexpectedly"

### **2. Transition Message**  
- **Before:** "Based on patterns like these... Here's how intelligence changes what happens next"
- **After:** "Patterns like these often lead to late detection. Here's what changes when causality becomes visible early"
- Removed "intelligence" self-promotion
- Made observational, not evaluative

### **3. Demo Section**
- **Headline:** "A Signal Appears Early" (was "Here's How OLynk Thinks")
- **Labels:** "SIGNAL → DEPENDENCIES VISIBLE → OUTCOME" (was "SCENARIO → OLYNK'S REASONING → ACTION TAKEN")
- Removed brand name from critical moments
- Used systems language throughout

### **4. Orientation Section**
- **Before:** "That Was Intelligence, Not Automation"
- **After:** "That Was Early Detection, Not Reaction"
- Removed "OLynk" and "your" pronouns from body copy
- Used "dependencies becoming visible" language
